## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- **Bonus**: Have their initial theme preference checked using `prefers-color-scheme` and have any additional changes saved in the browser

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<span>{{ Intl.NumberFormat('en-EN', {maximumSignificantDigits: 9}).format(result) }}</span>
```
```css
@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {Â }
@media (prefers-color-scheme: light) { }
:root { }

```
```js
export default class Calculator {
  // ...
}
```
### Useful resources

- [Media 'prefers-color-scheme'](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-color-scheme) - This helped me for use 'prefers-color-scheme' in styles.
